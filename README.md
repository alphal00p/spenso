# Spenso and Idenso

The spenso ecosystem is a symbolic and concrete tensor computation system designed for high-energy physics calculations. It provides automatic index matching for tensor networks, symbolic expression manipulation through integration with symbolica, and physics-aware simplifications for Clifford algebra, SU(N) color factors, and metric tensors. The system exposes both Rust and Python interfaces for maximum flexibility.
