# idenso

Idenso is the symbolic counterpart to spenso, providing extensions to symbolica's `Atom` to use algebraic relations to simplify expressions containing tensors written in spenso parsable format. 

It includes dirac algebra, color algebra, and various tensor simplification routines commonly used in high-energy physics calculations.
